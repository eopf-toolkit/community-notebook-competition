# The EOPF Zarr Community Notebook Competition

Welcome to the [EOPF Zarr Community Notebook Competition](https://thrivegeo.com/eopf-community-notebook-competition/)! We're inviting Sentinel data users and developers to create and submit their own innovative Jupyter Notebooks. The goal? To showcase the power of cloud-native workflows using the EOPF Zarr Sample Service and its accompanying plugins.

This competition is a great opportunity to expand your skills, contribute to the Earth observation community, and win prizes. Whether you're a seasoned expert or just starting your journey into cloud-native data, this competition is for you. We'll provide all the resources you need to get started, including the [EOPF 101 book](https://eopf-toolkit.github.io/eopf-101/), which is packed with case studies, example notebooks, and documentation.

## How to Participate
The competition is structured in five stages, designed to guide you from learning to submission and, finally, to an awards showcase.

### Stage 1: Launch & Registration
The competition officially begins with its launch at Big Data in Space on 30 September 2025. During this stage, you'll be able to [register your interest](https://thrivegeo.com/eopf-toolkit-competition/) to receive updates!

We'll also host an [introductory webinar on 16 October 2025](https://buytickets.at/thrivegeo/1879939) to help you get acquainted with the EOPF Sample Service ecosystem and the resources available to you. Sign-up now! 

### Stage 2: Learning & Development
This is where you'll dive deep into the [EOPF 101 book](https://eopf-toolkit.github.io/eopf-101/) and start building your notebook. We'll provide support through our [Discourse forum](https://discourse.eopf.copernicus.eu/t/eopf-zarr-activities-at-big-data-from-space/475), live Q&A sessions, and guided co-working sessions. 

The [EOPF Sentinel Zarr Sample Service JupyterLab](https://jupyterhub.user.eopf.eodc.eu/hub) will be your primary development environment.

Once you access with your CDSE credentials, you will get the chance to choose the language you want to develop with!

### Stage 3: Notebook Submission
Submit your completed Jupyter Notebook via GitHub once complete, between 1 November 2025 and 30 January 2026 (23:59 UTC+1). Clear guidelines, a notebook template and evaluation criteria will be provided in advance via this GitHub repository. We will also provide some challenge prompts to help get you started. Stay tuned!

### Stage 4: Judging & Evaluation
A panel of expert judges will evaluate each submission based on technical soundness, effective use of the EOPF Zarr data and plugins and educational quality.

### Stage 5: Awards & Showcase
The competition culminates in an online awards showcase where winners and highly commended entries will be announced. 

The top notebooks will be featured in the EOPF 101 book as new case studies and you will be given the chance to be a co-author of a publication on EOPF 101. 

There is also a prize pool of 10 000 Euros in upskilling vouchers sponsored by [thriveGEO](https://www.thrivegeo.com). In addition, there will be exciting ESA swag such as Sentinel-2 Lego sets up for grabs!
